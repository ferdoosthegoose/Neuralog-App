# Neuralog

Our app, Neuralog, serves as a tool for people struggling with memory loss or cognitive decline. Users will be able to manage the effects of memory loss, and easily log and look back at important memories. The timeline is the main function of our app where users can input memories with descriptions, a date, and photos, and look back at them as needed. We also included a 'People' tab where users are able to store details about the important people in their life and keep precious memories with them safe.
